        "Suppose I have to go up 5 steps. To get there, I first had to be in step 3, or in step 4. If I'm in step 4, I only have one way to get to step 5. If I'm in step 3, I have two ways to get to step 5: taking a step of 2, or taking two steps of 1. If I take two steps of 2, I get to step 4, which already had it accounted for and it would not be a different way. Therefore, I only have the possibility of taking a step of 2. It can be concluded, therefore, that to go up 5 steps, the different possibilities may correspond to the different ways of going up 4 steps + the different ways of going up 3 Steps.\n"
