# Algorithm coding
Just a collection of algorithms problems from improving my coding ability and algorithm skills

## My exercises:

* **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. https://github.com/albertofernandezvillan/algorithm-coding/blob/main/two_sum.ipynb

## Some quick notes
* [Why start + (end ‚Äì start)/2 is preferrable method for calculating middle of an array over (start + end)/2 ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/start-end-start2-preferrable-method-calculating-middle-array-start-end2/): integer overflow
